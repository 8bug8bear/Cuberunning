# CubeRunning

This is my first attempt to create a game from start to finish. I wanted this game to have everything that should be in a normal game, namely: the main menu, the selection of the level to pass, saving information about the passage, the settings menu, the escape menu and interesting game mechanics. About the mechanics in more detail: The game is made in the runner genre with shooter elements, it follows from the person that the game should be primarily interesting to run on the map. To do this, double jumps, wall running and regular running are implemented. The player also has a semi-automatic weapon. The opponents in which the player will shoot from this weapon are flying drones (for lack of other models, I used standard models of weapons that are in the engine), which are divided into two types: observer drones and arrow drones. Arrow drones periodically shoot at the place where the player was some time ago, this value can be set in their parameters and it is usually equal to a second. They make the player constantly move. The second type of drovnov is observer drones. They just keep an eye on the players. Killing them brings the player extra life time. And now about the time of life. This is another mechanic that forces the player to move forward. If the player does not manage to reach Finesh in a certain time, he will die. This time can be increased by killing drones. In addition to drones, the game is able to kill falling down from platforms and spikes that are spread out on platforms. also in the game there are party rooms, entering which the player is transported to a point in space specified in the portal parameters. At the same time, the player does not see in advance where his portal teleports him.
